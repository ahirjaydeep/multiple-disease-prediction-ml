# Multiple Disease Prediction System (Machine Learning + Streamlit)

This project is a simple **Multiple Disease Prediction System** built using **Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit**.  
I created this as part of my internship learning to understand the complete ML workflow — from data preprocessing to model training and building a web UI.

It predicts three conditions using Support Vector Machine (SVM) models:

- **Diabetes**
- **Heart Disease**
- **Parkinson’s Disease**

⚠️ **Disclaimer:**  
This is an academic/learning project.  
It is NOT a medical tool and should not be used for real diagnosis.

- Sidebar navigation in Streamlit  
- User input fields based on dataset features  
- SVM models trained with scikit-learn  
- Dataset preprocessing + feature scaling  
- Clean and simple UI built using Streamlit
